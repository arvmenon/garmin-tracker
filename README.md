# Garmin Tracker

This repo tracks requirements for a Garmin-first activity ingestion platform with future multi-provider support.

## Getting Started
- Review `REQUIREMENTS.md` for detailed provider scope, ingestion flows, metrics, authentication, and non-functional expectations.
- Contribute changes on the `development` branch and open a pull request for review.
- Documentation-only changes do not require code builds, but tests should accompany any future implementation.

## Branches
- `development`: active collaboration branch for documentation and feature work.
- `work`: historical baseline branch containing the initial drafts.
